# Delayed Miner Reward: Companion Code and Data for "When is Slower Block Propagation More Profitable for Large Miners?"

## Introduction

This project contains the code and data companion to the paper titled "When is Slower Block Propagation More Profitable for Large Miners?". The paper focuses on studying the impact of block delay in blockchain on mining rewards, utilizing the Markov Process (MP) and Markov Decision Process (MDP) for analysis.
